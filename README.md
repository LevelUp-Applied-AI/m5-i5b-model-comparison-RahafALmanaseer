1. `load_and_preprocess` — Load dataset, select features, split 80/20 with stratification
2. `define_models` — Define 6 model configurations as sklearn Pipelines (2×2 default/balanced + Dummy + DT)
3. `run_cv_comparison` — 5-fold stratified CV on all models; compute mean ± std for 5 metrics
4. `save_comparison_table` — Save results DataFrame to CSV
5. `plot_pr_curves_top3` — PR curves for top 3 models on one plot
6. `plot_calibration_top3` — Calibration curves for top 3 models
7. `save_best_model` — Persist best model with `from joblib import dump`
8. `log_experiment` — Log all model results with timestamps to CSV
9. `find_tree_vs_linear_disagreement` — Find one sample where RF and LR disagree most

Run the full script: `python model_comparison.py`
Run tests: `pytest tests/ -v`

## Submission

Your PR description must include:

1. Model comparison table (all 6 models × 5 metrics)
2. Decision memo (3–4 paragraphs recommending a model for Petra Telecom)
